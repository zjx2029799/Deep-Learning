The steps I did:

1. Analyze the 4564 pictures of single-cell graph and narrow down the number of targets on the graph into 2D data. 
2. Implement single layer, multiple layers and CNN neuron network to train the processed data by Tensorflow (up to 95% accuracy).
3. Improve the modelâ€™s loss and accuracy by initializing the data set with Autoencoder (Reduce 90% of training time)
